# CRUD Demo

A simple CRUD app that can add, update, or delete users.

The front end is React.
The backend is Node.js + Express.
The database is PostgreSQL.
State management is handled by React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) + context API.
The API is GraphQL, which is auto generated by postgraphile.
Apollo is used in the frontend to make GraphQL calls to the backend.
